# Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots for documentation.

## Required Screenshots

- `project-list.png` - Main project list view
- `timer.png` - Timer interface with project selected
- `notes.png` - Notes management interface
- `banner.png` - Main banner image for README

## Guidelines

- Use high-quality screenshots (preferably 1920x1080 or higher)
- Show the app in a realistic state with sample data
- Use consistent lighting and contrast
- Highlight key features where appropriate
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB per image)

## Naming Convention

- Use kebab-case for filenames
- Include descriptive names
- Add version numbers for major UI changes (e.g., `timer-v2.png`)
